## Buisness Understanding

Near the end of 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Wells Fargo to pay 2 billion in consumer redress and a 1.7 billion civil penalty. This resulted from customers having their vehicle wrongly possessed, illegally charging customers large fees and interest on auto and home loans, and charging 'unlawful' overdraft fees (https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/well-fargo-fines). 
Additionally, JD Power released their 2022 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. According to the study, the industry average score is 648. Wells Fargo scored well below the average; recording a score of 625. Dropping 3 points from 2021. In comparison to other competitors, Chase recorded a score of 678, and PNC recording a score of 658 (https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-us-national-banking-satisfaction-study). Although this does not pertain to fraud, this publicity is detrimental to the bank’s reputation. 

Nonetheless, in 2022, a survey conducted by Verint, asked respondents what is a major factor when deciding what bank to choose. Many of the answers reported cited “security of personal information,” “fraud protection,” and “fraud alerts” as the most important factors surrounding their banking selection. This beats out ‘low or no fees’ which was the the previous top concern of customers (https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/identity-and-access/bank-customers-now-rank-security-and-fraud-protection-ahead-of-low-fees). 

Based on the survey, by detecting fraudulent activity on a customers account and aiming to prevent it as soon as possible, Wells Fargo can establish a trusting relationship with their customers in hopes to maintain consumer retention and potentially increase the numbers of customers by generating a positive reputation.
